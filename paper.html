            Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or 
            grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, 
            printing, packaging, cleaning, decorating, and a number of industrial and construction processes
