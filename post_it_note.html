            A Post-it Note is a small piece of paper with a re-adherable strip of glue on its back, made for temporarily attaching 
            notes to documents and other surfaces. A low-tack pressure-sensitive adhesive allows the notes to be easily attached, 
            removed and even re-posted elsewhere without leaving residue
